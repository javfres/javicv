        <p>
            Hi!, I am Javier, a Software Engineer.

            For the last years I have been in a biotech startup working
            within a multidisciplinary team composed of
            people from all over the world.

            Now I am looking for my next challenge to grow as a developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lately I have been working with PHP and TypeScript.
            I have experience as a Full-stack,
            creating Rest APIs,
            making integrations with third-party systems,
            using Amazon AWS cloud, etc.
            But I don't miss any opportunity to learn new things.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a background in research
            with a PhD in parallel and high performance computing.
        </p>
