                    Biome Makers is a biotech company
                    that uses DNA sequencing to analyze
                    the microbiome in agricultural processes.

                    I was part of the core team that managed to
                    close Series A ($4M) in 2019 and Series B ($15M) in 2021.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I work in the various projects of the company:
                    the results client portal, our internal management tool,
                    or the analysis pipeline.

                    I collaborate with the
                    BioInformatics and DataScience
                    departments to
                    interconnect the different pieces of software
                    and feed information to our custom analysis pipeline.

                    The company is based in California and Spain.


                    My main task is to develop the client results portal
                    and all the related components, such as
                    online shop, notifications, rest api...

                    Our core stack includes PHP Laravel, Vue,
                    and PostgreSQL, all running over AWS instances.



                    Moreover, I work close with the BioInformatic team
                    to integrate Python programs in our data analysis pipeline.

                    I use Python to integrate bioinformatic programs
                    into our data analysis pipeline 
                    and store the results into PostgreSQL.

                    High Performance Computing.

                    I have multiple published papers in
