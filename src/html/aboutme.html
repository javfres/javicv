    <h2>About me</h2>

    <div class="text">
    
        <p>Hi!, I am Javier, a software engineer
            with experience in coding, testing and launching.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the last years I have been in a biotech startup working with 
            teammates from all over the world.

            Now I am looking for my next challenge to grow as a developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            My preferred languages are Python and Javascript
            but I don't miss any opportunity to learn new things.

            I have a background in optimizing
            with a PhD in parallel and high performance computing.
        </p>

        <!--
        <p>
            I am native Spanish speaker but fluent in English and
            I am used to write technical documents or papers. 
        </p>
